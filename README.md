# Airbnb-Price-Prediction


This project is a thorough examination of the Airbnb market of 6 major cities in US, where data exploration, cleaning, and preparation were conducted to gain insights into key factors that influence rental prices. A machine learning technique was then applied to predict Airbnb prices, which included model selection, training, and optimization to achieve the best prediction accuracy.
